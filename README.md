This is an implementation defining standard of client-side-validation, i.e. its
Core library.

Client-side-validation is a paradigm for distributed computing, based on top of
proof-of-publication/commitment medium layer, which may be a bitcoin blockchain
or other type of distributed consensus system.

The development of the library is supported by [LNP/BP Standards Association](https://lnp-bp.org).
The original idea of client-side-validation was proposed by Peter Todd with its 
possible applications designed by Giacomo Zucco. It was shaped into a protocol-
level design by Dr Maxim Orlovsky with a big input from the community and
implemented by him as this set of libraries.


## Documentation

Detailed developer & API documentation for all libraries can be accessed
at <https://docs.rs/client_side_validation/>

To learn about the technologies enabled by the library please check
[slides from our tech presentations](https://github.com/LNP-BP/FAQ/blob/master/Presentation%20slides/)
and [LNP/BP tech talks videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK_Q3xcQ-H3ERwArGaMKsxg)


## Components

This library consists of the following main three components, which define
independent parts constituting together client-side-validation API and its core
functionality. These are:
- Strict encoding (LNPBP-7 standard): binary standard of encoding 
  client-side-validated data
- Commit-verify scheme and its client-side-validation specific implementations
  * consensus commitments
  * multi-commitments (LNPBP-4 standard)
- Single-use-seals (LNPBP-8 standard)


## Usage

The repository contains rust libraries for client-side validation and 
command-line tools for debugging/low-level hacking mode.

### Use library in other projects

To use libraries, you just need lates version of libraries, published to 
[crates.io](https://crates.io) into `[dependencies]` section of your project 
`Cargo.toml`. Here is the full list of available libraries from this repository:

```toml
client_side_validation = "1" # "Umbrella" library including all of the tree libraries below
strict_encoding = "1" # Strict encoding API and derivation macros
commit_verify = "1" # Consensus and multi-message commitments
single_use_seals = "1" # Generic (non-bitcoin-specific) API
```

"Umbrella" `client_side_validation` library is configured with default set of
features enabling all of its functionality (and including all of other libraries 
from this repository, listed above). If you need to restrict this set, either
use specific libraries - or configure main library with a set of features in
the following way:
```toml
[dependencies.client_side_validation]
version = "1"
default-features = false
features = [] # Your set of features goes here
# Avaliable features
# * `derivation` - includes strict encoding derivation macros
# * `strict_encoding` - strict encoding library (by default does not include
#                       derivation macros, to use it you need`derivation` 
#                       feature to be explicetly enabled
# * `multi-commitments` - LNPBP-4 multi-commitments
# * `seals-all` - All single-use-seals component, including bitcoin seals 
#                 library
# * `seals-api` - single-use-seals core API (without bitcoin-specific extensions)
# * `seals-utxo - Bitcoin-based UTXO single-use-seals
```

For specific features which may be enabled for the libraries, please check
library-specific guidelines, located in `README.md` files in each of library
subdirectories.

### Libraries based on client-side-validation

Most of the developers will be probably interested in a more high-level 
libraries based on client-side-validation, applying it to a specific commitment
mediums (bitcoin transaction graph from blockchain or state channels, or more
exotic systems like confidential bitcoin transactions used by elements & liquid,
or mimblewimble-based systems). Here is (potentially incomplete) list of such
libraries:
- Bitcoin: [BP Core Lib](https://github.com/LNP-BP/bp-core), which contains 
  bitcoin UTXO single-use-seal implementations for pay-to-contract and 
  sign-to-contract types of seals, as well as a library for deterministic 
  bitcoin commitments. This library is maintained by LNP/BP Association.
- Mimblewimble: [MW Core Lib](https://github.com/pandoracore/mw-core) from 
  [Pandora Core](https://pandoracore.com) â€“ a very early prototypes and proofs 
  of concept applying client-side-validation to mimblewimble-types of 
  blockchains.
- [Pandora timechain](https://github.com/pandora-network/timechain), an 
  experimental blockchain of [Pandora Network](https://pandora.network), 
  experimenting with client-side-validation using modified bitcoin consensus 
  rules, extended with eltoo- and covenants-related functionality and with 
  removed native blockchain-level coin.

### Use command-line tool

First, you have to install rust toolchain using instructions from 
[the official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Next, if you need the latest published version, you can simply run
```shell script
cargo install client_side_validation
```
which will give you the latest version of the command-line tool. For now, you 
can use it by typing in terminal
```shell script
clisv help
```

If you need a latest `master` version (which may be unstable), you need to clone
git repository and compile the project locally:
```shell script
git clone https://github.com/LNP-BP/client_side_validation
cd client_side_validation
cargo install --path .
```
