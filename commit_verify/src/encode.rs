//! Encoding and data preparation for commitment procedures in
//! client-side-validation as defined by [LNPBP-9] standard.
//!
//! Client-side-validation commitment process requires special encoding of
//! the data. While [`strict_encoding`] is the main standard for atomic data
//! types in client-side-validation world and should be used during internal
//! protocol-specific data validation, commitments may require processes of
//! merklization arrays of data items, or hiding confidential parts of the
//! data via hashing, pedersen commitments and so on. Thus, additionally to
//! strict encoding, a set of different encodings and data convolution and
//! hiding procedures are defined in `commit_verify` library. This includes:
//! - **merklization** procedure, operating special types of tagged hashes and
//!   committing to the depth of each node;
//! - **conceal** procedure, making data confidential (transforming types into
//!   confidential versions).
//!
//! [`CommitEncode`] is the main trait which should be implemented for all data
//! types participating in client-side-validation. It takes [`io::Write`]
//! encoder and serializes into it data which corresponds to the exact
//! commitment. These data mus be concealed, if needed, merkelized etc. The
//! encoder is usually a hash function of specific type, which may be keyed with
//! a tag.
//!
//! Main patterns of [`CommitEncode`] implementation can be automatically
//! applied to a type by using [`amplify::strategy`] adaptor. These patterns
//! include:
//! - [`strategies::IntoU8`], which converts the type into U8 using `Into` trait
//!   and serializes it.
//! - [`strategies::IntoInner`], which converts the type into inner type using
//!   `Wrapper` trait and serializes it.
//! - [`strategies::Strict`], which serializes the type into the hasher using
//!   [`strict_encoding::StrictEncode`] implementation for the type.
//! - [`strategies::ConcealStrict`] does the same, but runs [`Conceal::conceal`]
//!   on the self first, and serializes the result using strict encoding.
//! - [`strategies::Id`] can apply to types implementing [`CommitmentId`]. It
//!   computes a single id for the type and then serializes it into the hasher.
//! - [`strategies::Merklize`] can apply to types implementing
//!   [`super::merkle::MerkleLeaves`]. It merkelizes data provided by this trait
//!   and serializes merkle root into the hasher. [`CommitmentId`] should be
//!   implemented for types which has external identifiers
//!
