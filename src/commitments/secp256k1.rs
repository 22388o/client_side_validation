//! Library for Secp256k1 elliptic curve based collision-resistant commitments, implementing
//! [LNPBPS-0001](https://github.com/LNP-BP/lnpbps/blob/master/lnpbps-0001.md)
//!
//! In order to use, first implement `TweakSource` traid for your source data type, which you
//! would like to commit to. `from` function must transform your custom data structure into
//! byte array (`message`) and also provide a name for the commitment protocol you are using.
//! The sample below show how this can be done for a string type:
//!
//! ```rust
//!     impl<'a> From<&'a str> for TweakSource<'a> {
//!       fn from(msg: &'a str) -> Self {
//!           TweakSource {
//!               protocol: "str",
//!               message: msg.as_bytes()
//!           }
//!       }
//!   }
//! ```
//!
//! After this, define an original public key you would like to use for a commitment and create
//! and instance of `TweakingEngine` using this key. Method `engine.reveal` will create the data
//! for public key tweaking procedure (`TweakData`), including the tweaking `factor` and random
//! `nonce`. These data can be used later for both commit phase (public key will be tweaked with
//! these data creating an actual commitment) and reveal phase (i.e. they will allow any third
//! party to verify the actual commitment):
//!
//! ```rust
//! let original_pubkey = PublicKey::from_str("02d1d80235fa5bba42e9612a7fe7cd74c6b2bf400c92d866f28d429846c679cceb").unwrap();
//! let engine = TweakingEngine(original_pubkey);
//! let msg = "Some message";
//! let tweak = engine.reveal(&TweakSource::from(msg));
//! let commitment = tweak.commit();
//! assert!()
//! ```
//!
//! NB: The library works with `secp256k1::PublicKey` and `secp256k1::SecretKey` keys, not
//! their wrapped bitcoin counterparts `bitcoin::PublickKey` and `bitcoin::PrivateKey`.
