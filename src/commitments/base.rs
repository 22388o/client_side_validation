//! Implementation of different cryptographic commitment primitives, focused around LNPBPS-0001
//! (collision-resistant elliptic curve-based commitments). Also covers more standard hash
//! commitments. In the future, with the addition of new LNPBPS for cryptographic commitments the
//! support must be extended to cover sign-to-contract scheme, Schnorr's signatures etc
//!
//! To use, first implement `Committable` trait for the data structure to which you'd like commit to.
//! Define which of the provided commitment schemes you plan to use and construct corresponding
//! `CommitmentSource` type containing all data necessary for constructing the actual commitment,
//! for instance implementing trait `From` for CommitmentSource-derived type on some source data
//! type. Then use corresponding `CommitmentEngine` to produce `RevealData`-typed structure.
//! From the reveal data you can both generate the actual commitment with `commit` function or
//! verify existing commitment with `verify` function.

/// In order to commit to some data the data structure must implement this trait
pub trait Committable<CS: CommitmentSource> {}

/// Data structure containing all necessary information for producing deterministic commitment
pub trait CommitmentSource {}

/// Any structure which may contain cryptographic commitment must implement this trait
pub trait CommitTarget {}

/// Trait for preparing structured data for commitment and verification from some source data
pub trait CommitmentEngine<CT: CommitTarget, CSRC: CommitmentSource, CS: CommitmentScheme<CT>> {
    /// Creates data in form of `RevealData` that is used for both commit and verify procedures.
    /// Takes `CommitmentSource`-enabled data source.
    fn construct(&self, src: &CSRC) -> CS;
}

/// Trait that must be implemented by a structured data that have to be committed to
pub trait CommitmentScheme<CT: CommitTarget>: Sized {
    /// Commits to it's content returning the actual commitment supporting `CommitTarget` trait
    fn commit(&self) -> CT;

    /// Verifies the provided commitment against it's own data
    fn verify(&self, commit: CT) -> bool;
}
